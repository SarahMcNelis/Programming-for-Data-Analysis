# Programming-for-Data-Analysis


This repository contains 2 projects which I completed as part of my Programming for Data Analysis module for my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics.

<br>

## Overview 

## `Numpy-random-project`
This folder contains a jupyter notebook and readme. The project requried me to investigate, analyse, explain and display how the Numpy random package works. To view this project [click here](https://github.com/SarahMcNelis/Programming-for-Data-Analysis/tree/main/Numpy-random-project).

## `Research-project`
This folder contains another jupyter notebook and readme. For this project I was required to create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of my choosing. Then model the data using the numpy random package. As I completed this project back in 2021 I chose to use the coronavirus pandemic as my inspiration.
